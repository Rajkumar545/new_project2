          <p>  Cricket is by far the most loved sport in India and constitutes part of the country’s culture. It was first introduced during the British rule of India and has then become tightly connected to the country’s history and tradition.
            
            The Indian Premier League (IPL), a professional Twenty-20 cricket competition, which was founded in 2008, is currently the most-attended cricket league in the world. According to data from Duff & Phelps, the brand value of the IPL in 2019 was US $6.7 billion. The league is widely followed by Indians and provides a considerable contribution to the country’s economy. The league’s governing body, BCCI, claimed that the 2015 league’s season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the GDP of India.</p>

    <p>
        Kabbadi is a sport native to the Indian subcontinent and has for centuries been one of the most popular disciplines in the country.
        
        The Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) is the top flight of the competition in India. The league was launched in 2014 and has since seen great popularity among fans and viewers. The PKL’s inaugural season attracted 435 million TV viewers (second only to the Indian Premier League’s 552 million).</p></section>

   <p> 
    Football (soccer) is another discipline introduced in India during the British colonial period. However, whereas Indians have had some of the world’s best cricket players and teams, they haven’t yet seen comparable success with their football efforts. 
    
    India has never participated in the World Cup, although it was invited to take part in 1950 where other Asian teams pulled out (the legend has it that Indians refused to participate because they were not allowed to play barefoot).</p>

    <p>
        Badminton is currently the second most played sport in India, right after cricket. It has also been growing in terms of TV viewership.
        
        The country has also seen some success on the international level, with some of its players, such as Saina Nehwal, Srikanth Kidambi, and Pusarla Venkata Sindhu ranking among the world’s top.</p> </section>
